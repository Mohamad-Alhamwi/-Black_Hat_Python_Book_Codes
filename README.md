# Black Hat Python Book Codes

The aim of this repository is keeping the codes and scripts I have written during the exciting journey of reading the book "Black Hat Python" by Justin Seitz.

Some changes and improvements that have been made to the book's codes:

* Added my own notes and comments.
* Made my own changes to the variables and methods names.
* Fully converted the codes to Python 3.
* Reformatted and restructured the codes to comply with [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standards.
